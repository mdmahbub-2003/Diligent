Prompt for SQL Query Joining Multiple Tables:

"Write an SQL query for the e-commerce SQLite database that joins multiple tables to generate a comprehensive report. The query should:

1. Join the following tables: customers, orders, order_items, products, suppliers.

2. Select relevant fields such as customer name, email, order date, product name, category, quantity, unit_price, total per item (quantity * unit_price), supplier name.

3. Filter orders with status 'completed' and order_date within the last 6 months (assuming current date is today).

4. Group the results by customer and order, calculating total order amount.

5. Order the results by total order amount descending, then by order date descending.

6. Limit the output to top 100 results.

7. Include aggregate functions like SUM for total amounts.

The output should provide insights into top customers, their recent purchases, product details, and supplier information."
