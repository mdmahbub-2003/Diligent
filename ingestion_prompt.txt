Prompt for Ingesting Data into SQLite Database:

"Write a Python script to ingest the synthetic e-commerce data from CSV files into a SQLite database. The script should:

1. Create a SQLite database named 'ecommerce.db'.

2. Create tables for customers, products, orders, order_items, and suppliers with appropriate data types and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).

3. Read data from the CSV files: customers.csv, products.csv, orders.csv, order_items.csv, suppliers.csv.

4. Insert the data into the respective tables, handling any data type conversions if necessary.

5. Ensure data integrity by checking for foreign key relationships (e.g., customer_id in orders must exist in customers).

6. Use Python's sqlite3 module for database operations and pandas or csv module for reading CSV files.

7. Include error handling for file reading and database operations.

8. Print progress messages and final confirmation of successful ingestion."
